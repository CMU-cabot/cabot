# CaBot

CaBot (Carry on Robot) is an AI suitcase to help people with visually impairments travel independently. Can you imagine to walk around at airports without vision? Itâ€™s huge open space and there are lots of things and people, so that it is really dangerous for them to walk around at airports. [see project detail](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NavCog/cabot.html)

## CaBot v2

CaBot v2 uses ROS1, ROS2, and ros1_bridge to use [navigation2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) package for ROS2 and existing packges for ROS1. Also, it uses Docker container to maintain development/production systems.

### Hardware assumption
Item|Product
---|---
LiDAR|Velodyne VLP-16
Stereo Camera|RealSense D435
Motor Controller|ODrive Motor Controller v3.6 or above (Firmware v0.5.1 or above)
Micro Controller|Arduino [Link TBD]() for controlling handle, IMU, and other sensors
PC|ZOTAC Magnus EN72070V

### Localization
- AMCL or mf_localization (cartogrpher+iBeaons)

### Tested Environment

- Host Ubuntu 20.04
- Docker v20
- docker-compose v1.28~
- Docker containers
  - `ros1`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic
  - `ros2`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS2 galactic
  - `bridge`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic, ROS2 galactic
  - `localization`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic
  - `people`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic

## Setup

- import thirdparty repos by using vcstool
```
pip3 install vcstool # if you don't have vcs
tools/setup-thirdparty-repos.sh
```
- run all script in tools based on your requirements
```
cd tools
./install-docker.sh                # if you need docker
./setup-display.sh                 # for display connections from docker containers
./setup-usb.sh                     # if you run physical robot
./setup-model.sh                   # if you need to recognize people
./install-realsense-udev-rules.sh  # if you use realsense camera
```
- build docker containers
```
cd docker
./prebuild-docker.sh [-p <project_name>]
./build-docker.sh [-p <project_name>] [-P]

-p option can specify docker-compose's -p option to build docker images in different name prefix
   Please check docker-compose help to see the detail.
-P option with build-docker.sh will also run ./prebuild-docker.sh
```
- prepare docker/.env file
  - ROS_IP       host machine IP address
  - MASTER_IP    ROS1 master IP address
- run containers. This will show up Rviz.
```
./launch.sh [-p <project_name>] [-n <log_name_prefix>] [-r] [-s]

-p option can specify docker-compose's -p option
-n set log name prefix (all logs and bag file should be stored in a directory) default=cabot
-r record camera image
-s launch in simulation mode
```

### Navigate CaBot on Gazebo simulation

- `Navigation 2 Goal` tool does not work properly. 
- You need to use CaBot menu instead, find `xterm` terminal displaying `type 'j', 'k', or 'l' for 'up', 'center', 'down' buttons`
- Type `k`, `k`, `k` to start navigation.

### CaBot app for iOS

TBD

## Customization

See [customization](doc/customization.md) for more details.

## Getting Involved

### Issues and Questions

Please use Issues for both issue tracking and your questions about CaBot repository.

### Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

The developer need to add a Signed-off-by statement and thereby agrees to the DCO, which you can find below. You can add either -s or --signoff to your usual git commit commands. If Signed-off-by is attached to the commit message, it is regarded as agreed to the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1.
