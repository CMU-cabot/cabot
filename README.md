# CaBot

CaBot (Carry on Robot) is an AI suitcase to help people with visually impairments travel independently. Can you imagine to walk around at airports without vision? Itâ€™s huge open space and there are lots of things and people, so that it is really dangerous for them to walk around at airports. [see project detail](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NavCog/cabot.html)

## CaBot v2

CaBot v2 uses ROS1, ROS2, and ros1_bridge to use [navigation2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) package for ROS2 and existing packges for ROS1. Also, it uses Docker container to maintain development/production systems. 

### Tested Environment

- Ubuntu 16.04 / 20.04
- Docker v19
- docker-compose v1.25
- Docker containers
  - `ros1`: Ubuntu18.04, ROS1 melodic
  - `ros2`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS2 foxy
  - `bridge`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic, ROS2 foxy

## Setup

- import thirdparty repos by using vcstool
```
pip3 install vcstool # if you don't have vcs
cd thirdparty
vcs import < thirdparty.repos
```
- run all script in tools based on your requirements
```
tools/setup-display.sh        # for display connections from docker containers
tools/install-docker.sh       # if you need docker
tools/setup-usb.sh            # if you run physical robot
```
- build docker containers
```
cd docker
./prebuild-docker.sh
./docker-build.sh
```
- prepare .env file
  - set your host computer's IP
- run containers. This will show up Rviz. 
```
docker-compose up
```

### Navigate CaBot on Gazebo simulation

- `Navigation 2 Goal` tool does not work properly. 
- You need to use CaBot menu instead, find `xterm` terminal displaying `type 'j', 'k', or 'l' for 'up', 'center', 'down' buttons`
- Type `k`, `k`, `k` to start navigation.

## Customization

See [customization](doc/costomization.md) for more details.
