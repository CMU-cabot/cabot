# CaBot

CaBot (Carry on Robot) is an AI suitcase to help people with visually impairments travel independently. Can you imagine to walk around at airports without vision? Itâ€™s huge open space and there are lots of things and people, so that it is really dangerous for them to walk around at airports. [see project detail](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~NavCog/cabot.html)

## CaBot v2

CaBot v2 uses ROS1, ROS2, and ros1_bridge to use [navigation2](https://github.com/ros-planning/navigation2) package for ROS2 and existing packges for ROS1. Also, it uses Docker container to maintain development/production systems.

### Hardware
- Robot frame + handle
  - [CaBot2-E2 model](https://github.com/CMU-cabot/cabot_design/tree/master/cabot2-e2)
  - [CaBot2-GT model](https://github.com/CMU-cabot/cabot_design/tree/master/cabot2-gt)
- LiDAR
  - Velodyne VLP-16
- Stereo Camera(s)
  - 1 RealSense camera (D435)
  - 3 RealSense cameras (**under development**)
- Motor Controller
  - ODrive Motor Controller v3.6 (Firmware v0.5.1)
- Micro Controller (Handle and sensors)
  - [cabot-arduino](https://github.com/CMU-cabot/cabot-arduino) for controlling handle, IMU, and other sensors
- Processor
  - PC with NVIDIA GPU (ZOTAC Magnus EN72070V)
  - NUC (Ruby R8) + Jetson Xavier NX (**under development**)

### Localization
- [mf_localization](https://github.com/CMU-cabot/cabot/tree/dev/mf_localization) (cartogrpher+iBeacons/WiFi)

### Tested Environment
- PC
  - Host Ubuntu 20.04
  - Docker v20
  - docker-compose v1.28~
  - Docker compose services
    - `ros1`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic
    - `ros2`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS2 galactic
    - `bridge`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic, ROS2 galactic
    - `localization`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic
    - `people`: Ubuntu20.04, ROS1 noetic
- Jetson (**under development**)
  - Host Ubuntu 18.04
  - Docker compose services
  - `people-jetson`: Ubuntu18.04, ROS1 melodic (source build with python3), Jetson

## Setup
- import thirdparty repos by using vcstool
  ```
  pip3 install vcstool # if you don't have vcs
  tools/setup-thirdparty-repos.sh
  ```
- run all script in tools based on your requirements
  ```
  cd tools
  ./install-docker.sh                # if you need docker
  ./install-arm-emulator.sh          # if you build docker image for Jetson
  ./install-host-ros.sh              # if you watch system performance
  ./install-realsense-udev-rules.sh  # if you use realsense camera
  ./setup-display.sh                 # for display connections from docker containers
  ./setup-usb.sh                     # if you run physical robot
  ./setup-model.sh                   # if you need to recognize people
  ```

## Build Docker Images
- build docker containers (at top direcotry)
  ```
  ./build-docker.sh -P                              # for build all images for PC with nVIDIA gpu
  ./build-docker.sh -g mesa -P                      # for build all images for PC with mesa/OpenGL compatible gpu
  ./prebuild-docker.sh l4t && ./build-docker.sh l4t # for build image for Jetson (only people)
  ```

## Launch
- prepare .env file
  ```
  ROS_IP               # host machine IP address or 127.0.0.1 for single PC setting
  MASTER_IP            # ROS1 master IP address or 127.0.0.1 for single PC setting
  CABOT_SITE           # package name for cabot site (default=cabot_site_cmu_3d)
  ROBOT                # robot name (default=cabot2-gt1)
  CABOT_INITX          # initial robot position x for gazebo
  CABOT_INITY          # initial robot position y for gazebo
  CABOT_INITZ          # initial robot position z for gazebo
  CABOT_INITA          # initial robot angle (degree) for gazebo
  CABOT_TOUCH_PARAMS   # touch sensor parameter for cabot-arduino handle default=[128,48,24]
  GAMEPAD              # gamepad type for remote controll (ex. PS4 controller) / pro (Nintendo Switch Pro controller)
  ```
- run containers. This will show up Rviz.
  ```
  ./launch.sh -s       # for simulator
  ./launch.sh          # for robot
  ./launch.sh -r       # for robot with recording rgb camera
  ```

- run people on jetson
  ```
  ./jetson-launch.sh
  ```

### Navigate CaBot

- **`Nav2 Goal` tool does not work properly**: the robot will move with the nav2 default BT xml (only for debugging purpose)
- right click on a blue dot in `demo_2d_floors.rviz` (-Y option for ros1 service to show) and select "Navigate to Here" menu
- or directory publish a `/cabot/event` topic on ROS1. see [here](doc/destinations.md) more detail about destinations.
  ```
  # example destination in cabot_site_cmu_3d environment
  $ rostopic pub -1 /cabot/event std_msgs/String "data: 'navigation;destination;EDITOR_node_1496171299873'"
  ```

### CaBot app for iOS

TBD
