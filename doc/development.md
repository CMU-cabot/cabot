## Development details

## Scripts

build docker images 

- see `./prebuild-docker.sh -h` for options
- see `./build-docker.sh -h` for options

### Manage docker images script

A utility script to tag, pull, push, list, or rmi (remove) images.
(not support l4t, jetson image yet, see [jetson](jetson.md))

- see `./manage-docker-image.sh -h` for options

### Docker-compose files

[see docker](../docker) for details of each images.
Docker images manage required software/library to build and run CaBot packages.
Most of CaBot packages will not be built as docker image layers.

So, most ROS1/2 CaBot workspaces should be built after building/pulling docker images.
docker-compose files mount home directory (`docker/home`) and required CaBot packages into the corresponding workspace to keep built binaries on the host file systems.

`launch.sh` will select the proper docker-compose file to launch.
